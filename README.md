## My Journey

### From Learning to Company

#### 2021 September: The Beginning

I started my coding journey as a computer student learning **C#**, diving into loops, conditions, and variables. My curiosity for programming grew quickly as I developed a deeper understanding of software concepts.

#### 2022 June: Python and OOP

In the summer of 2022, I joined a **Python** programming course which enhanced my problem-solving abilities. I further developed my skills through online courses, exploring key concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, functions, and arrays.

#### 2022 October: Web Development

After mastering Python, I decided to focus on web development. I started with **HTML** and **CSS**, learning responsive design and semantic elements to create interactive and user-friendly webpages.

#### 2023 March: Diving into JavaScript

I then explored **JavaScript** and its modern features (ES6, DOM manipulation, Promises, Hoisting), which empowered me to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

#### 2023 Summer: Internship at MRK

I completed an internship at **MRK**, where I worked with **Express.js** and built APIs to handle server-side data. This experience gave me real-world exposure and a deeper understanding of backend integration in full-stack development.

#### 2023 September - 2024 October: TV Management Project

After my internship, I joined a team and worked on the **TV Management** project using **React.js** and **Express.js**, creating a seamless user interface and backend support with APIs.
